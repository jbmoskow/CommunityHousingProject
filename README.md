# CommunityHousingProject
## Data analysis and visualization for the 2020 Queen's University PhD-Community Initiative

We constructed a survey of 18 questions addressing various demographic, socioeconomic, and other information which we administered to individuals on the City of Kingston's centralized waiting list for community housing. So far we have received a total of 80 completed surveys.

Using Juypter Notebooks I have run both an exploratory analysis (*CHP_Exploratory.ipynb*) and a dimensionality reduction (*CHP_PCA.ipynb*) of this dataset.
