# CommunityHousingProject
## Data analysis and visualization for the 2020 Queen's University PhD-Community Initiative

We constructed a survey of 18 questions in order to obtain demographic, socioeconomic, and other information which from individuals on the City of Kingston's centralized waiting list for community housing. We received and analyzed data for a total of 100 surveys.

Using Juypter Notebooks I have run both an exploratory analysis (*CHP_Exploratory.ipynb*) and a dimensionality reduction (*CHP_PCA.ipynb*) of this dataset.
